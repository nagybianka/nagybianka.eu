Happy Wednesday! My fall inspiration board is a little bit on the late side as I just started to relaunch my blog. I started this blog two years ago. The aim was to jot down my travel experiences, but as I travel less nowadays my blog was left in the cold. I thought time has come to give this blog another chance and try to broaden its horizon.

This board was inspired by the happy couple having an autumnal picnic in the woods. As temperatures are dropping, I tend to gravitate towards heartier meals, sipping decadent hot chocolate, eating apple crumble, taking a long walk in the woods, enjoying the leaves turning into a yellow, crimson and brown color palette and layering on clothes!
