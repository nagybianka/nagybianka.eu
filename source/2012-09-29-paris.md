We are going to Paris for a long weekend! I am really excited about it, as it's our first holiday abroad with Ella and it's the first time I am traveling again since my pregnancy. I am little bit scared as I don't know what to expect when traveling with a baby. This time around we are renting an apartment which we found through [airbnb](http://airbnb.com). The apartment is located near Montmartre and Opéra, close to all the mayor sightseeing attractions. What would you recommend when traveling with a baby?
