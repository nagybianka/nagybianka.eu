In May 2011 we went on holidays to New York city for 8 days. It was my first time in New York city and I immediately fell in love with the city. We visited most of the touristy things: Central Park, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, Guggenheim museum, Fifth Avneue, walked over the Brooklyn Bridge to Dumbo neigboorhood, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Battery Park with view of the Statue of Liberty, Wall Street, High Line park, United Nations building.

We ate cupcakes at a cutest little [cupcake shop](http://www.littlecupcakebakeshop.com) and saw the actor Gabriel Bryne from the movie The Usual Suspects. We also spotted Sarah Jessica Parker walking around Greenwich, that was for me a Sex and the City moment. We walked a lot, we had such a great time there!

Here are some tested and approved restaurants and bars:

* [Shake Shack](http://www.shakeshack.com/): we ate the best hamburgers ever, we had to queue for at least a half an hour, but it was so worthy.

* [Westville restaurant](http://www.westvillenyc.com/): Fresh food for reasonable prices. We tried the menu of the day, our meals was very tasty.

* [Five points restaurant](http://www.fivepointsrestaurant.com/): We went to Five Points restaurant for brunch. I had the eggs in cocotte, very tasty. My absolute favorite would be the Raisin-Walnut French Toast with Cr√®me Anglaise & Caramelized Bananas. Heaven!

* [Rooftop bar](http://www.230-fifth.com): 230 Fifth (230 5th avenue). Rooftop bar with amazaing view over Manhattan. Dress code: dress to impress!

* [Radegast hall](http://www.radegasthall.com): German beergarden in Brooklyn.

We went for a drink or two in St. Marc's neighboorhood, we tried some local beers and wines bar. I can't recall the name of the bar anymore.

Of course, we had to do a little shopping as well. We discovered some nice boutiques and outlets. I am a huge fan of [J.Crew](http://jcrew.com), I splurged some money there. Now I can only shop online, they ship internationally, yay! But it's not the same, I still like to try on the clothes, as you never know which size fits you the best.

We are invited to another wedding this year in September in New Jersey, I am really thinking about attending the wedding and return to New York city for a couple of days.
A couple of weeks ago I read this great [blog post](http://joannagoddard.blogspot.be/2013/05/three-great-nyc-bike-rides.html) about discovering New York city by bike. Joanna from a cup of joe is suggesting three bike routes: across the Brooklynn Bridge from Mahattan to Dumbo, Central Park loop, and The Hudson River Greenway. If we return, it's definetly on my to do list.
Next time I would also like to see a show on Broadway, we didn't have time to see one last time. Also, on my wish list, a boat trip to Coney Island. So much to see, so little time!
