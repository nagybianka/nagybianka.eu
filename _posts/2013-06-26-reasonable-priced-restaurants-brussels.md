We live in Leuven, 25 km or 30 minutes ride from Brussels. As my sister lives in the capital, I often go to visit her. Sometimes we have lunch together in one of the restaurants here below: 

If you like a mix of international and French cuisine, head to [Restaurant le Malte](http://www.lemalte.be) in Saint-Gilles (Rue Berckmans 30). Their lunch menu costs 9.5 euro, with tea or coffee 11 euro. Really reasonable prices! For lunch I had the beef burger maison and my sister had the salad de roquette. They serve good sized portions, you don't leave hungry, that's for sure. We also tried some dishes from their regular menu, I really liked the beef with red vine and shallot sauce, and the mixed fish grill.

In the trendy fashion area, next the chique Rue Dansaert, you can find restaurant [Publico](http://www.publicobxl.be/) (Rue des Chartreux 32, 1000 Brussels). They serve a fresh and creative cuisine. You can stop by just for coffee, a relaxing lunch, or an evening dining with flair. I really liked the duck in marsala sauce and for dessert dame blanche ice cream. After dinner we usually go to one of the popular bars in this trendy neighboorhood.

In the heart of the European headquarters, near place Schumann, I discovered a small and charming restaurant [Le Corr√®ge](http://www.lecorrege.be/). The restaurant is mainly open during lunch time, except for Thursday and Friday evenings. The food is excellent, they serve dishes according which fish, vegetables and fruits are in season. They have a couple of regular dishes on the menu as well. Lunch costs 14 euro, with appetizer 17 euro and with dessert 20 euro. Every lunch I ate here was delicious. My favorite was the chicken normandaise with apples and cognac sauce. I seem to like sauces :-)!
