Temperatures have been dropping here in Belgium, evenings feel cool. There is a crisp breeze to the air that hints autumn is coming.

In the shops the new collections for autumn/winter 2013 are slowly coming in. I have noticed the ultra flattering drop waist dresses in some collections. This dress suits every body type. I really like these dresses pictured below.
