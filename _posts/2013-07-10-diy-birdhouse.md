I recently saw these cute birdhouses and deer heads in one of my favorite shops. The birdhouses and deer heads are from the [Italian Miho Unexpected](http://www.mikkili.com/home-accessories/catalog/miho-unexpected-design/) design. The designs are elegant and funny and have a colorful look. They are made from recycled MDF. But, I didn't want to spend a lot on a design birdhouse.

After bumping into this DIY on Pinterest, I decided to make my own little birdhouse from cardboard. I found a birdhouse template on the blog of [Karmuca y Cuquino](http://karmucaycuquino.blogspot.jp/2011/07/casita-para-pajaros.html). I decorated my cardboard birdhouse with leftover wrapping paper, I only purchased a little fake bird for â‚¬3. My version of the birdhouse is not that fancy and it can be more finetuned, but I am happy with the final outcome.
