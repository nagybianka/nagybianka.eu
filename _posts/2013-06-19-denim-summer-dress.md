I came across this denim embroidered summer dress on Pinterest. The styling is perfection with a brown belt and sandals. I can imagine wearing this dress on a warm summer day to go to the farmers market, to the beach or just going for a walk. Although the picture dates from 2010, I managed to find a similar style from Mango. I want it!
