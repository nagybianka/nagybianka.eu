We left [Playa del Carmen](/blog/playa-del-carmen-mexico) early morning by bus to head to Tulum. Another 45 minute drive, once we arrived in Tulum it was scorching hot.

In tulum we stayed in the a small [Hotel Don Diego de la Selva](http://dondiegodelaselva.com) on the south end of Tulum. We opted not to stay in a beachfront cabaña as running water and electricity are a necessity with a baby. The hotel is situated in a lush tropical garden with a swimming pool, isolated from the outside world. In the hotel bee hives are cultivated from a local bee called meliponas. The meliponas don't stingue. The owners make honey and soap and shampoo.

There are three types of rooms: double room, family room and 2 cabañas. Every room has a large terrace or an individual balcony with garden views. The hammock on the balcony is added plus to relax or to read a book. Homemade breakfast (fresh fruit juice, homemade jam and honey, and huevos rancheros or a piece of cake) is included in the price. The staff was super friendly and helpful, they sterlized our baby bottles and heated up the baby food in the microwave.

Their restaurant El Paladante serves a mix of Mexican and European cuisine. The food is delicous, but the portions are a little bit on the small side. I tasted the chicken mole and the veal in red wine sauce, both dishes were mouth watering. I read in the guide book that the owners also have a small ecohotel on Tulum beach, Don Diego de la Playa.

The wedding took place in Akiin Tulum beachclub. The ceremony was on the beach with the turquoise Caribbean sea as a backdrop, it was one of the most beautiful weddings I have ever been invited to. Apetizers and welcome drinks were served on the beach, followed by dinner in a big cabaña. The evening was perfect!

During our stay in Tulum, besides lounging by the pool, we visited the ruins of Tulum, it is one of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites. The ruins are situated on 12m tall cliffs, along the east coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. It has a picturesque view of the Caribbean. I think pictues speak for themselves :-)!
