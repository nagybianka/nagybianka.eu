Have a nice weekend! What are your plans for the weekend? This weekend we are going to [Piknik Musik](http://www.piknikmusik.be) with some family members. Everybody will bring some delicious bites along. Piknik Musik is huge city picnic with summer tunes playing in the background. Also, we are celebrating my birthday this evening. We will be having dinner at a vegetarian restaurant. A banana pie is already waiting for me!

Here is my weekly inspiration from around the web.

* We are going to [Piknik Musik](http://www.piknikmusik.be) on Sunday.

* I will be making this delicious [pasta](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/quick-recipes/2013/07/pasta-with-tomatoes-and-mozzarella) and this yummy [dessert](http://www.een.be/programmas/dagelijkse-kost/recepten/aardbeien-en-limoenroom-op-een-krokante-bodem) (in Dutch) to savour at the picnic.

* These tropical fruit cocktails from [Camille Styles](http://camillestyles.com/drinks/10-best-tropical-fruit-cocktails/) make me dream of a tropical holiday.

* I really liked the gorgeous New York appartement of blogger Kat Tanita from [With love from Kat](http://www.withlovefromkat.com) featured on the [Glitter Guide](http://theglitterguide.com/2013/07/09/style-at-home-kat-tanita-of-with-love-from-kat/).

* In a recently dug-up video [Dustin Hoffman](http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/07/09/watch-dustin-hoffman-on-what-tootsie-taught-him-about-beauty/?iid=nf-main-trend-now) explains how it was playing a woman in Tootsie.
