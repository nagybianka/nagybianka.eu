Have a gorgeous weekend! What are your plans for the weekend? The weather forecast is predicting warm weather for the weekend and all next week! Finally summer is here! Saturday I am going to a vegetarian dinner party. I am looking forward seeing my friends, it's been a long time. Here are some inspiration from around the web.

* This [frozen watermelon slush](http://www.youaremyfave.com/2013/07/02/frozen-watermelon-slush-is-my-fave/) is just a perfect drink to beat the heat.
