Have a great weekend! We are looking forward to a quiet weekend, no parties, no big family gatherings to attend. My sister will drop by Saturday for breakfast and to play with Ella. Otherwise if the weather is better we will go for a walk. We are fed up with the cold and rain. Here are some inspiration from around the web.

* Great [picnic ideas](http://theglitterguide.com/2013/06/20/picnic-in-the-park-with-caitlin-wilson-textiles/).

* Summer sale starts next week Monday and I am eyeing this [skirt](http://www.zara.com/be/en/woman/skirts/mini/printed-skirt-with-ruffles-c401023p1236502.html). This [lamp](http://www.zarahome.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product/zarahomegb/en/zarahomegb/680608/2876080/Cubos%2BLamp) for the bedroom. And this cute [shirt](http://www.zara.com/be/en/kids/baby-girl/shirts/shirt-with-flower-appliqué-c361512p1048388.html) for Ella.

* I read this inspiring [career profile](http://theeverygirl.com/feature/sam-saifer-berngard-of-skoog-productions/) on the Everygirl.

* Cute [outfit idea](http://awelltraveledwoman.tumblr.com/post/17728792424/foxontherun-via-my-all-mine) for the weekend.

* I made this delicous [roast provençal chicken recipe](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/2013/06/roast-provencal-chicken) on Thursday. It was a hit and will try it again with potatoes and roasted vegetables next time.

* These [summer looks](http://www.elle.fr/Mode/Dossiers-mode/Un-look-a-la-Jane-Birkin) from Elle France are stunning. Makes me dream of the French Riviera.

* We had this [vintage Fisher Price Queen Buzzy Bee Toy](http://www.etsy.com/listing/153664649/vintage-fisher-price-queen-buzzy-bee-toy?ref=sr_gallery_39&ga_search_query=toys&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_ship_to=US&ga_original_query=2&ga_search_type=vintage). Ours had broken wings and one of the antenna's was missing as well. Memories!

* As of 1 July 2013 Google Reader will no longer exist. I already imported my Google Reader feeds to [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com). I am still learning how to work with it. I will miss Google Reader for sure.
